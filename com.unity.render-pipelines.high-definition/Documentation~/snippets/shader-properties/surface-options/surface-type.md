<tr>
<td>**Surface Type**</td>
<td>Specifies whether the material supports transparency or not. Materials with a **Transparent Surface Type** are more resource intensive to render than Materials with an **Opaque** **Surface Type**. Depending on the option you select, HDRP exposes more properties. The options are:<br/>&#8226; **Opaque**: <br/>&#8226; **Transparent**: Simulates a translucent Material that light can penetrate, such as clear plastic or glass. Selecting **Transparent** exposes more properties in the **Surface Options** section as well as an extra [Transparency Inputs](#TransparencyInputs) section.<br/>For more information about the feature and for the list of properties each **Surface Type** exposes, see the [Surface Type documentation](../../../Surface-Type.md).</td>
